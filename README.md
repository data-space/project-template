GitHub doesn't display HTML files, which is odd, or Word documents, which isn't surprising.
It does though display Rmd and PDF files. 
RStudio can be configured to knit PDF files.

R projects can be published to <http://shinyapps.io> or <https://rpubs.com>.

Python notebooks will be displayed correctly by GitHub. 

There seem to be [many ways to run Python online](https://blog.ouseful.info/2014/12/12/seven-ways-of-running-ipython-notebooks/).
One of these is [Binder](https://github.com/binder-project/binder), which looks like an interesting project.
