## Helpful Hints (delete this)

See these two links for help on GitHub markdown syntax:

Check out syntax highlighting in the second link. 

GitHub doesn't display HTML files, which is odd, or Word documents, which isn't surprising.
It does though display Rmd and PDF files. 
RStudio can be configured to knit PDF files.

R projects can be published to <http://shinyapps.io> or <https://rpubs.com>.
The Jupyter Notebook running in a Docker container can create R and Spark notebooks. 

Notebooks will be displayed correctly by GitHub. 
This suggests that using the Jupyter Docker Notebooks make sharing results easy. 

There seem to be [many ways to run Python online](https://blog.ouseful.info/2014/12/12/seven-ways-of-running-ipython-notebooks/).
One of these is [Binder](https://github.com/binder-project/binder), which looks like an interesting project.
